**Updated on 19th July with an additional wave of data**, see `_v2` files

`pandemic_panel_models.R`: script for fitting all models (NB: computationally intensive)

`pandemic_panel_mainplots.R`: plots and tables for main manuscript (depends on the `pandemic_panel_fits.RData` generated by `pandemic_panel_models.R`)

`pandemic_panel_supps.R`: supplementary plots and tables (depends on the `pandemic_panel_fits.RData` generated by `pandemic_panel_models.R`)

`main_data.csv` and `exposure_data.csv`: data for all models

`reliability_data.csv`: data for reliability analysis of religiosity items

`codebook.R`: a codebook for all three data sets

`eurostat2021.csv`: external data for poststratification

`SupplementaryDocument.pdf`: supplements including discussion of causal inference, missing data, the statistical models, simple prior and posterior predictive checks of all models, details on poststratification and imputation, as well as supplementary results, and a list of R packages, their dependencies, and version number used for the project.

The R package `renv` helps to ensure a reproducible package environment and is required to run the scripts.

Some system details:
